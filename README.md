# alialhasnawi.github.io

This is just a test site for learning basic web development. Why don't you **[visit it?](https://alialhasnawi.github.io/)**
The  website is built using the holy trinity of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

### Current Projects
1. **[Just a regular piano.](https://alialhasnawi.github.io/piano/)** *nothing interesting, it's just a regular piano*
- Uses the [Tonejs](https://tonejs.github.io/) framework for note playback.

2. **[Animal Crossing dialogue box.](https://alialhasnawi.github.io/animal/)** *Text-to-Speech based on Animal Crossing villagers*
- Uses the Web Audio API.

3. **[watchitwithme!](https://alialhasnawi.github.io/watch/)** *simple video scraper and chat service*
- Backend Node.js server runs on a Heroku free-tier dynamo (which is why first load is slow).
- Webscraping uses the [puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) package.
- Although Github Pages are usually static, dynamic functionality was added using the WebSockets API.

### Unfinished Projects
1. GLtest. *please ignore this, I'll come back to it later*
- WebGL is hard.
